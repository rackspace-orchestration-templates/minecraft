They are kept up to date with upstream and you can read about each setting in more\ndetail [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#Minecraft_server_properties)\n\n### Known issues\n\nMinecraft internally regenerates all of its configuration files every startup. The order of server.properties sometimes changes, timestamps are\nand headers are injected into all the configuration files.\n\nThis in turn causes chef to notice configuration files have been changed and will automatically restart the server again to pick up those changes. This may\ncause your server to restart frequently, without notice.\n\nThis leaves you with two work arounds for now.\n\n1. Only run chef-client once a day or manually as  you need to.\n2. Set minecraft['autorestart'] = false and restart minecraft manually when you make configuration changes.\n\nI am hoping I can get this changed upstream. I will attempt to come up with a better work around in the mean time.\n\n##Contributing\n\n1. Fork it\n2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)\n3.
