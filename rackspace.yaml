  #### Getting Started
  Review the settings for your server to make sure they are in line with the
  game you wish to run. For example, you can set whether or not to allow pvp.
  The configuration file is in /home/minecraft/. The server can be restarted
  by restarting the "minecraft-server" service.

  #### Lock it down
  This deployment will create a Cloud Server with Minecraft. Once the
  server is online, you should set a white-list in your
  [server.properties](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties)
  file. This will lock down your server to only players you specify.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
